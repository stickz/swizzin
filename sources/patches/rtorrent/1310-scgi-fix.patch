Subject: [PATCH] Resolve scgi software crash

This commit resolves a scgi software crash when the scgi socket is closed before the message can be sent. It instructs `::send()` not to send a SIGPIPE termination signal. Instead the value -1 is returned and handled bellow. The SCgiTask is closed and a new one is sent to complete the task.

```
Thread 3 "rtorrent scgi" received signal SIGPIPE, Broken pipe.
                                                             [Switching to Thread 0x7fffe635c6c0 (LWP 2443872)]
0x00007ffff7929a84 in send () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
